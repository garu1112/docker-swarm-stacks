## Overview

Docker Swarm Stacks is designed to help developers quickly deploy common backing services used in the development cycle. This project contains Terraform modules for deploying Docker stacks into a Swarm cluster. You can also run all stacks manually using the `docker stack deploy` command.

For the latest releases, check the [Releases section](https://github.com/garu1112/docker-swarm-stacks/releases).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

### AWS Configuration

You need to set up your AWS configuration files. Below are the required settings.

**~/.aws/config**
```
[profile localstack]
region=us-east-1
output=json
endpoint_url=http://localhost:4566
```

**~/.aws/credentials**
```
[localstack]
aws_access_key_id=test
aws_secret_access_key=test
```

## Getting Started

To initialize your Docker Swarm, run the following command:

```shell
docker swarm init --task-history-limit=0
```

This command sets up your Swarm environment and prepares it for stack deployment.

## Automated Setup

Using Terraform, you can provision a Docker Swarm cluster, deploy stacks, and manage resources seamlessly. This approach saves time and reduces the complexity of manual setups.

### Steps for Automated Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/garu1112/docker-swarm-stacks.git
   cd docker-swarm-stacks
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```shell
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Plan the Deployment**
   ```shell
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply the Configuration**
   ```shell
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Deploy the Stacks**
   After Terraform finishes, your stacks will be deployed automatically.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to deploy stacks manually, you can do so with the `docker stack deploy` command. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Navigate to the Stack Directory**
   ```shell
   cd <stack-directory>
   ```

2. **Deploy the Stack**
   ```shell
   docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml <stack-name>
   ```

This method gives you more control over the deployment process.
